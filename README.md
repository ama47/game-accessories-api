# E-commerce Backend Project

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive backend system solution for an e-commerce website that specializing in furniture sales. The system provides a scalable and manageable infrastructure that handles essential aspects
of e-commerce operations, including product catalog management, order processing,payment handling, and more.

## Product Display Structure

The back-end system organizes the furniture inventory into a multi-level product catalog. At the top level are broad product categories, such as Bedroom and Living Room.

Within each primary category, there are granular subcategories. For instance, the Bedroom category includes subcategories like Beds, Dressers, and Nightstands.

Each subcategory houses individual product listings. For example, under the Beds subcategory, you'll find specific items like King Bed, Single Bed, and Kids Bed, each with its own detailed information such as price,and weight.

**(Categories -> Subcategories -> Individual Products).**

This hierarchical structure allows customers to easily navigate the catalog and find the exact furniture pieces they need. The backend efficiently manages this taxonomy, ensuring fast access and seamless updates to categories, subcategories, and products.
